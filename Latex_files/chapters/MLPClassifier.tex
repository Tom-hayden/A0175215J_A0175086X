\subsection{Data Preprocessing and Augmentation}
	    
\begin{itemize}
   	\item Normalization
  	
  	The input data is normalized to lie within the range [0,1].
    	
  	\item Mean subtraction
	    	
   	To further normalize the data, a the mean is subtracted on a per-pixel basis.
	    	
   	\item Data augmentation
	    	
   	Experience shows that a larger training data set increases network performance
\end{itemize}
	    
\subsection{Network Structure}
	    
\begin{itemize}
   	\item Basic structure
	    	
   	Since this is a classification problem, parts of the network structure are fixed. The last layer consists of 10 nodes and a in a "softmax" configuration. PICTURE of basic structure.
	    	
	\item Number of hidden layers/nodes
	    	
	Parameter search over 1-3 hidden layers, 1-500 neurons
	    	
	    	
\end{itemize}
	    
	    
\subsection{Optimization of Further Network Parameters}
	    
\begin{itemize}
   	\item Different learning rates
	    	
   	\item Different optimization methods
\end{itemize}
