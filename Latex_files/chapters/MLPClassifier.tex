	    \sectionauthor{M. Gini}

This section should contain:

a) on the selection of the inputs and outputs of the MLP
b) on the size of the training data
c)on the training of the MLP
d) on the performance of the MLP with different objective functions and optimization methods
e)any other interesting observation that you think are pertinent (e.g. effect of learning rate on convergence speed).

\subsection{Data Preprocessing and Augmentation}
	    
\begin{itemize}
   	\item Normalization
  	
  	The input data is normalized to lie within the range [0,1].
    	
  	\item Mean subtraction
	    	
   	To further normalize the data, a the mean is subtracted on a per-pixel basis.
	    	
   	\item Data augmentation
	    	
   	Experience shows that a larger training data set increases network performance
\end{itemize}
	    
\subsection{Network Structure}
	    
\begin{itemize}
   	\item Basic structure
	    	
   	Since this is a classification problem, parts of the network structure are fixed. The last layer consists of 10 nodes and a in a "softmax" configuration. PICTURE of basic structure.
	    	
	\item Number of hidden layers/nodes
	    	
	Parameter search over 1-3 hidden layers, 1-500 neurons
	    	
	    	
\end{itemize}
	    
	    
\subsection{Optimization of Further Network Parameters}
	    
\begin{itemize}
   	\item Different learning rates
	    	
   	\item Different optimization methods
\end{itemize}
