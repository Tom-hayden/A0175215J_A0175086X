This section gives a literature review on the broad topic of neural networks. Section \ref{sec:litReviewCifar} gives a more specific review on neural network designed to classify the CIFAR-10 dataset. The significance and applications will be reviewed in section \ref{subsec:signif} while recent trends and accomplishments are discussed in section \ref{subsec:trends}.

\subsection{Significance and Applications of Neural Networks}\label{subsec:signif}

This subsection will illustrate the significance and applications of neural networks.

One of the most important applications of neural networks is computer vision. Ever since

The significance of neural networks lies in the fact that the are able to achieve very high performance on tasks which are very difficult with other techniques.

\subsection{Recent Trends and Accomplishments}\label{subsec:trends}

Recent trends and accomplishments of neural networks are discussed in this subsection. Since neural networks are such a broad topics, only two recent accomplishments are looked at in detail: The AlphaGo computer program and adversial examples. AlphaGo is a great example to illustrate recent trends and is also considered one of the biggest accomplishments of deep neural networks up to date. Adversial examples can easily fool very different kinds of neural networks and are therefore a great example to show that enthusiasm maybe should be insulated.

AlphaGo is a computer program developed by DeepMind, a company owned by Google. It uses deep learning and is able to beat the world champion. This gained considerable media coverage since it is a feat experts thought would still be a decade away [CITE]. The game Go is considered the most complex board game, with a number of legal positions of in the order of magnitude of $10^{170}$\cite{tromp2006combinatorics}.

Interesting development: Adversial examples

Adversial examples are a recalcitrant problem. It is a potential security problem. Studying them can im
