CNN is a more advanced architecture compared to a MLP network. Similarly to a MLP, it consists of an input as well as an output layer, as well as several hidden layers. The hidden layers typically consist of convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers and normalization layers. Due to that, CNN are usually much deeper than MLP networks.

However, CNN require significantly more computing power to train. Even though MATLAB supports training on the GPU, some quick maths reveal that our computational resources are insufficient for extensive parameter search of a CNN.
