Two literature reviews gather a considerable amount of knowledge about ANN.     

A MLP is implemented using MATLAB. Several parameter searches over the network structure and its hyperparameters are conducted.

The random initialization of the weights provides another possibility to explore the parameter space.

Furthermore, a CNN is implemented as well. A few different architectures are tested and a performance exceeding the MLP performance is achieved. Due to the computational limitations, the main focus of this report is laid on the MLP classifier.     
     
The excessive use of quick maths also improved our network architecture.
