A literature review was carried out showing the strengths and limitations of using ANNs for a variety of tasks. The state-of-the-art architectures for the CIFAR-10 data set were examined and possible improvements were suggested. In addition, application areas of image recognition algorithms were investigated and ANNs proved key to progress.

We also trained our own MLP and CNN classifiers in MATLAB. The MLP network architecture and hyper parameters were heavily tested and optimised to give a satisfactory MLP classifier. Whilst the results of the MLP classifier do not compare favourably against the state-of-the-art, they prove that even using relatively simple methods it is possible to achieve good results. Testing of the CNN revealed that it heavily outperformed the MLP classifier. Possible improvements to increase the performance of both networks have been suggested.

This report has proved machine learning to be an excellent tool when applied to image classification tasks. It has been demonstrated that ANNs can be applied as a black box model with no a-priori knowledge of the classification process being required.
